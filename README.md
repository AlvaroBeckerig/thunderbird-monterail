# thunderbird-monterail

This is a set of userChrome.css files to change the look of Thunderbird, inspired by the mockup by Monterail here:
https://monterail.com/blog/2016/the-power-of-email-clients-why-did-we-redesign-thunderbird?utm_source=Thunderbird&utm_campaign=Dribbble&utm_medium=blogpost%22

- 3 css files are included for a light theme, dark theme and coloured theme using monterail inspired colours.
- EncodeSans Narrow is included and used as the font throughout thunderbird.
- Also inluded is a set of svg icons which replace the default Thunderbird icons, mostly taken from the incredible Font-Awesome (http://fontawesome.io)

To use these themes, the easiest way is to download the thunderbird-monterail.zip folder and extract its contents to your
thunderbird user config directory (normally /home/*\[user\]*/.thunderbird/*\[random letters and numbers\]*.default/)
This will create the chrome folder (if it doesn't exist) containing the icons, font, and all 3 css files.

Simply copy the css file for whichever theme you want to use and rename it userChrome.css and then restart Thunderbird
